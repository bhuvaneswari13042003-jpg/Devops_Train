What is Vagrant?
Vagrant is a tool used to create and manage virtual machines easily for development.
    
Think of it this way:
VirtualBox creates the virtual computer.
Vagrant controls it using simple commands.

Vagrant uses a Vagrantfile to define how the virtual machine should be set up. This makes it easy to recreate the same environment on any system.

Why Developers Use Vagrant

Same environment works on every machine
Easy to start and destroy virtual machines
Setup is quick and repeatable
Keeps main system clean and conflict-free
